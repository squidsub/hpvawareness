        <p>Human Papillomavirus(HPV)is a common sexually transmitted infection. More than 90 percent of sexually active men and 80 percent of sexually active women are affected by it in their lifetime. </p>
        <p>HPV is the most common STD(sexually transmitted disease), but most of the time it isn’t a big deal. It usually goes away on its own, and most people don’t even know that they ever had HPV.</p>
        <p>About a dozen types of HPV can sometimes lead to cancer, but two in particular (types 16 and 18) lead to the majority of cancer cases. These are called high-risk HPV.</p>

        <h2>⚠️High-Risk HPV⚠️</h2>
        <p>High-risk HPVs can cause several types of cancer. There are 12 high-risk HPV types: HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59. Two of these, HPV 16 and HPV 18, are responsible for most HPV-related cancers.</p>
        <p>Doctors worry more about the cell changes and pre-cancers linked to these types, because they're more likely to grow into cancers over time.</p>

    <div id="section2" class="main">
        <h2>How do you get HPV?</h2>
        <p>HPV can be passed from one person to another by skin-to-skin contact, such as occurs with sexual activity. The main way HPV is spread is through sexual activity, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex. HPV can be spread even when an infected person has no visible signs or symptoms.</p>
        <p>HPV infection is very common. Most men and women who have ever had sex get at least one type of genital HPV at some time in their lives. <u>Anyone</u> who has had sex can get HPV, even if it was only with only one person, but infections are more likely in people who have had sex with multiple partners</p>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <div id="section3" class="main">
        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p>There’s no "good" way to prevent infection with all the different types of HPV. 
            But there are things you can do to lower your chances of being infected. There are also vaccines that can be used to protect young people from the HPV types that are linked to cancer and genital warts.</p>
        <p>HPV is passed from one person to another during contact with an infected part of the body. Although HPV can be spread during sexual contact – including vaginal, anal, and oral sex – sex isn’t the only way for the infection to spread. 
            All that’s needed is skin-to-skin contact with an area of the body infected with HPV, however, there may be other ways of HPV spreading that has not been discovered yet.</p>
